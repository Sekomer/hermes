# DAT files
> `.dat` files are source codes that has already been lexed & parsed, so these
> are the final program but in a more compressed format.  
> One reason for these files is that they are much faster to run.
> If you compile your program down to a `.dat` file and execute it through hermes,
> then hermes does not need to go through the lexing or parsing stage again, it will
> just execute it right away.

> So in short, `.dat` files are a lot faster to execute.

## Executing a .dat file
> This is currently not supported ... funny huh?
